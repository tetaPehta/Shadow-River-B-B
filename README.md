## Design 
     
     - #### Colour Scheme
       - Main color used is #rgba (58, 58, 58). Slate grey is main masonary color that is used on the farm Therefore the theme flows from real enviroment into the webpage.The guest easly connects the real-life color to website presenting the farm.

     - #### Typography
       - The Lora font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Lora is an elegant but readble font from small to large font size, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

     - #### Images
       - Images are important to show what the guest can expect in real life when visiting Shadow river Farm.

     - #### Wireframes
       - Balsamiq is used for wireframes. Links below.

Failed code: 

1. I tried to add padding in between .conteiner paragraphs. At the moment it does not show. Will try different approach.
2. Media queries between 950px and 1200px do not apply correctly. Will try different aproach.

   * RESULT: I have solved the braking point issue with conteiners by removing the padding between conteiners and not ionside the card like previously tried. This resulted in correct responsive media query.


GALLERY section
I did not like the look of the gallery we have learned to style in our module. I searched online for different options and style. Every option on W3Schools had Java added. I wanted to use HTML and CSS only. I found this tutorial on Youtube :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McPdzhLRzCg. I followed the instructions. I could understand how wrapping and sliders work. I have implemented the new knolege into the Gallery style.

Failed code:
The gallery looks ok, but the slides are not efective. I have to go back and find my error in the code.
Fixed the error in CSS code .
