## Design 
     
     - #### Colour Scheme
       - Main color used is #rgba (58, 58, 58). Slate grey is main masonary color that is used on the farm Therefore the theme flows from real enviroment into the webpage.The guest easly connects the real-life color to website presenting the farm.

     - #### Typography
       - The Lora font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Lora is an elegant but readble font from small to large font size, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

     - #### Images
       - Images are important to show what the guest can expect in real life when visiting Shadow river Farm.

     - #### Wireframes
       - Balsamiq is used for wireframes. Links below.

### Failed code: 

1. -  Media queries between 950px and 1200px do not apply correctly.

   * RESULT OF FIXED CODE: Error solved by removing the padding between conteiners and not inside the card like previously tried. This resulted in correct responsive media query.

2. - Gallery Images not showing in Mozzila browser.

  * RESULT OF FIXED CODE: Error solved by transforming JPG format too WEBP format. Gallery displays correctly.

3. - Slide buttons not displaying on MAC device and on Windows for screens size 950px and down.

  * RESULT OF FIXED CODE: Upon inspection of my commits, I have noticed that I have deleted CSS code that targeted Slider navigation. After watching the Youtube tutorial, I  
    have succesfully applied the changes. 

3. Low Lighthouse performance for mobile.

  * - RESULT OF FIXED CODE: Compress all Images with Tiny Ping.com. Lighthouse score improved from 75 to 89 on Performance.
