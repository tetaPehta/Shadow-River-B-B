Hello to the reader of my first README.md 

I own a farm and B&B in Annascaul, Co.Kerry. I have build a website for the business 3 years ago with a website builder and hosting provider.

This time I'm building from code for the first time. I had no coding experience before this course. 

I'm following and re-watching the videos in the Love Running module for creation of this project. 

The content for the page comes from my current Shadow River website and Booking.com public testimonials, from our past guests.

All images and videos are a realistic representation of what our guests can expect when visiting the farm. 

All media used was filmed by me and Eva Veber, @Eving.Photography. More can be found on www.eva.veber.com
