Hello to the reader of my first README.md 

I own a farm and B&B in Annascaul, Co.Kerry. I have build a website for the business 3 years ago with a website builder and hosting provider.

This time I'm building from code for the first time. I had no coding experience before this course. 

I'm following and re-watching the videos in the Love Running module for creation of this project. 

The content for the page comes from my current Shadow River website and Booking.com public testimonials, from our past guests.

All images and videos are a realistic representation of what our guests can expect when visiting the farm. 

All media used was filmed by me and Eva Veber, @Eving.Photography. More can be found on www.eva.veber.com

OFFER section

I have found "Meet the tem" code on W£Schools. I have implemented a part of that code into my "OFFER" section.

Failed code: 

1. I tried to add padding in between .conteiner paragraphs. At the moment it does not show. Will try different approach.
2. Media queries between 950px and 1200px do not apply correctly. Will try different aproach.

   * RESULT: I have solved the braking point issue with conteiners by removing the padding between conteiners and not ionside the card like previously tried. This resulted in correct responsive media query.


GALLERY section
I did not like the look of the gallery we have learned to style in our module. I searched online for different options and style. Every option on W£Schools had Java added. I wanted to use HTML and CSS only. I found this tutorial on Youtube :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McPdzhLRzCg. I followed the instructions. I could understand how wrapping and sliders work. I have implemented the new knolege into the Gallery style.

Failed code:
The gallery looks ok, but the slides are not efective. I have to go back and find my error in the code.
